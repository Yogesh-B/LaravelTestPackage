1. Go through the `Package Development` page on laravel documentation. Just read the whole page, did not get idea how to actually make one.
2. Went online for tutorials. Tried one tutorial but was too simple, Then another that was actually making some class and use it.
3. First achieved working class. Without autoload/service provider or facade.
4. Then got the facade working.
5. Then got the service provider working.

- One who might be looking to learning for package development should go step by step. (I used AI code assist and AI Chatbot for faster resolution of hurdles/problems.)
